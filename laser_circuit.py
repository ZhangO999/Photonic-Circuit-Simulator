LaserCircuit - Responsible for storing all the components of the circuit and
handling the computation of running the circuit. It's responsible for delegating
tasks to the specific components e.g. making each emitter emit a photon, getting
each photon to move and interact with components, etc. In general, this class is
responsible for handling any task related to the circuit.

You are free to add more attributes and methods, as long as you aren't
modifying the existing scaffold.

        You will need to find your own way to check for symbol collisions
        with other receivers.
